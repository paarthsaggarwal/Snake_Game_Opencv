# Snake_Game_Opencv

This is a very fun game which is just like 2D snake but without YOU having to touch the keyboard! Isn't that amazing? All you have to do is let the computer detect your hand and the game starts. Move immediately though, otherwise you may or may not die.

# Libraries needed to install

1. Opencv

pip install opencv-python

2. cvzone (it will automatically install numpy for you)

pip install cvzone
